"""Optional Claude-backed help: explain one tool call, or answer a question
about a transcript.

Nothing here runs unless asked. A transcript carries source code, file contents
and tool output, so no call is made in the background, on load, or ahead of a
click — the viewer is local-only until you press a button.

The `anthropic` SDK is an optional extra (`pip install "atif-view[ai]"`) so the
package keeps its zero-dependency install; these features simply hide when it,
or a credential, is absent.
