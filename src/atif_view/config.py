"""Viewer settings, including optional API tokens.

A token kept in a file is weaker than one in the system keychain or a password
manager, so this module is deliberately narrow about them:

  * they live at ~/.atif/config.json, 0600, inside a 0700 directory;
  * they are never returned to the page, never logged, and never put in a URL —
    the page only ever learns that one is set and its last four characters;
  * they are only ever read to authenticate a request.

The environment is still honoured. With nothing stored, each service's usual
variables apply as they would anywhere else.
