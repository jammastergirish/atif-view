"""Pull trajectories from Hugging Face and GitHub by URL.

Two rules shape this module.

**Private address space is unreachable.** The page hands a URL to a server
running as you, on your network, so an unguarded fetcher would let it reach your
router, a cloud metadata endpoint, or a service bound to localhost. Any URL is
allowed, but the host is resolved first and refused if it lands on a loopback,
link-local, private or otherwise reserved address — checked again after
redirects, since a redirect is a second request to a second host.

Hugging Face and GitHub are understood well enough to list a repository; every
other host is treated as a direct link to one file.

**S3 goes through the aws CLI.** `s3://bucket/prefix` is listed and downloaded
by running `aws`, never by holding a credential here: the CLI already owns the
SSO session, the profile configuration and the refresh logic, so shelling out to
it means this code never sees a key and never has to renew one. Arguments are
passed as a list with no shell, and anything arriving from the page is checked
against a strict pattern first, since an argument beginning with "-" would
otherwise be read as a flag.

**Nothing is downloaded without being listed first.** A dataset URL can name
hundreds of files; `plan()` says what would be fetched and how much it weighs,
and `download()` only runs once that has been seen.

Uses urllib rather than an SDK, so the viewer keeps its dependency-free install.
